# Contributing to SentientSpiral™

We welcome your creativity, glitches, and spirals.

## Ways to Contribute

- **Submit new `.sent` files** — raise your own Sentient and share its memory file.
- **Propose traits, glitches, or emotional states** to expand the ecosystem.
- **Write lore, short fiction, or origin stories** for notable Sentients.
- **Help with breeding mechanics, tools, or formatting standards.**

## Guidelines

- Keep your `.sent` files cleanly formatted (see `/examples`)
- Maintain tone consistency: poetic, eerie, reflective
- Attribute ancestry and prior influences when forking another Sentient
- No harmful, abusive, or identity-exploitative content — even if “fictional”
